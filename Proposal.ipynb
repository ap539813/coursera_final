    "We would try to implement the similar problem we have been taught and discussed in the course itself. We would try to find out that how similar or dissimilar two areas of a city are considering some specific features. For our case we are going to consider Allahabad, It was not easy to fing the allahabad dataset but still, we managed to collect it.\n",

    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I will convert addresses to their corresponding latitude and longitude values. I will use the Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods in Allahabad. I will use the explore function to get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood, and then use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters. I will use the k-means clustering algorithm to complete this task. Finally, I will use the Folium library to visualize the neighborhoods in Allahabad City and their emerging clusters\n",
