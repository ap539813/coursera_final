    "This Neighborhood Dataset has a total of 5 boroughs and 306 neighborhoods. In order to segment the neighborhoods and explore them, we will essentially need a dataset that contains the 5 boroughs and the neighborhoods that exist in each borough as well as the latitude and longitude coordinates of each neighborhood. Luckily, this dataset exists for free on the web. Feel free to try to find this dataset on your own, but here is the link to the dataset: https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu_2451_34572 For convenience, I downloaded the files and placed it on the server\n",
